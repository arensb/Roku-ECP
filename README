* SSDP
According to
http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/External+Control+Guide
the Roku supports Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), which is
the basis for UPnP.

I think that what that example doesn't tell you is that SSDP uses UDP,
not TCP, so run 'ncat' with "-u".

Presumably need to send out the SSDP HTTP query out over UDP, while
listening on UDP for incoming connections. By the same token, need to
specify the port for the return connections to come in on.

11 is the Channel Store.
28 is the ID of a channel in the store.

Also works with private channels, looks like.
Doesn't work with string channel IDs, though.

837 is the YouTube channel
The ContentID is the YouTube video ID.
